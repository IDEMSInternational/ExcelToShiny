A system for creating Shiny dashboards using Excel spreadsheets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ExcelToShiny from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/ExcelToShiny")
```

## Overview

ExcelToShiny enables users to define Shiny dashboards using Excel spreadsheets. This approach makes it easy to specify dashboard components, including:

- **Main Page**: Global dashboard settings.
- **Contents Page**: Defines the structure of the Shiny app.
- **Display Pages**: Creates different visualization components.
- **Tabbed Pages**: Organises pages into tabbed layouts.
- **Download Pages**: Allows data downloads with optional access control.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to load an Excel file and use it to generate a Shiny dashboard:

```r
library(ExcelToShiny)
library(readxl)
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(dplyr)

# Load example Excel file
data_list <- rio::import_list("data/example_dashboard.xlsx")

# Build the Shiny dashboard
build_shiny(
  title = "Example Shiny Dashboard",
  data_list = data_list,
  key_var = "ID",
  status = "primary",
  colour = "blue"
)
```
