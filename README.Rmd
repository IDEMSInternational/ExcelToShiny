A system for creating Shiny dashboards using Excel spreadsheets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ExcelToShiny from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/ExcelToShiny")
```

## Overview

ExcelToShiny enables users to define Shiny dashboards using Excel spreadsheets. This approach makes it easy to specify dashboard components, including:

- **Main Page**: Global dashboard settings.
- **Contents Page**: Defines the structure of the Shiny app.
- **Display Pages**: Creates different visualization components.
- **Tabbed Pages**: Organises pages into tabbed layouts.
- **Download Pages**: Allows data downloads with optional access control.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to load an Excel file and use it to generate a Shiny dashboard:

```r
# Load libraries
library(ExcelToShiny)
library(dplyr)
library(rio)
library(NHANES)

# Load your data you want to run
data(NHANES)

# Run manipulations. Here's an example of where we use a second data frame in our Shiny Excel
NHANES_by_ind <- NHANES %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(count = 1:n()) %>%
  filter(count == 1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Set the key variable to be the same type
NHANES$ID <- as.character(NHANES$ID)
NHANES_by_ind$ID <- as.character(NHANES_by_ind$ID)

# Run any credentials data for downloading page
credentials_data <- data.frame(
  user = "admin",
  password = "password",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Call in the test data
path <- system.file("extdata", "example_data.xlsx", package = "ExcelToShiny")
all_sheets <- rio::import_list(path)

# Your shiny app
build_shiny(
  title = "Test Dashboard",
  data_list = example_excel,
  data_frame = NHANES,
  key_var = "ID"
)
```
